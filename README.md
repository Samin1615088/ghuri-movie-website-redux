# MOVIE MELA WEBSITE
This is a website of movies where user needs to be authenticated to see the upcoming movie. For movie data I have used TMDB API. I have used Redux for practice purpose and used it for storing users details<br/>


- users need to authenticated to get access to the website.
- TMDB API is used for data sources.
- Redux is used for user details storage.
